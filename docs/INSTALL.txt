atreal.massloader Installation
==========================

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``atreal.massloader`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        atreal.massloader
        
 * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
