Overview
========
MassLoader allows to do massive uploads via Zip or 7Zip files. When an archive
is uploaded via MassLoader, its contents are created in the current folder.


Description
===========

* MassLoader creates Files and Images or only Files with files in archive.
* MassLoader add an action on Folder, Large Plone Folder and Plone Site. You can
  change theses portal types in the control panel.
* MassLoader has a content size limit, and is able to protect your server from
  logic bombs.
* MassLoader can handle any size of archive file, without overload of your server.


Important
=========

* The permission is only set by default to the role 'Manager' and 'Owner'.
* From the version 3.0.0beta1, the portal type of new object can be managed via
  2 mechanisms, selectable in the control panel :
  
  * If content type registry detects an Image, MassLoader creates an Image, if
    it's not an image MassLoader creates a file with the portal type selected
    in Control Panel.
  * Or the checkbox is checked in Control Panel and Massloader creates only
    files with the portal type selected in Control Panel/

* Default max size for each file to be uncompressed is set to 20 Mb. You can
  modify this size limit in the control panel.
* If a folder with a same id already exists, it is conserved. If a same file
  exists whith the same id, just the datas are updated.


Issues
======

* 7zip archives are not valid when they contain only empty folders (problem with
  python library pylzma).
* 7zip archives with empty folders : the empty folders are not created.
